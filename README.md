Automated Trading System for Stock Prediction
The Automated Trading System leverages machine learning algorithms and financial data to predict stock price movements and generate actionable trading signals. The system analyzes historical stock data, financial statements, and market indicators to predict future trends, guiding investors toward informed decisions. Built with scalability and ease of use in mind, this system can be extended to include more companies and data sources, making it a versatile tool for stock market analysis.

The project employs a Random Forest Regressor model to predict stock price movements based on past stock prices, technical indicators, and fundamental financial data like income statements and balance sheets. It generates predictions (Buy, Sell, Hold) that can be used to inform trading decisions. The system also includes built-in model evaluation features to ensure consistent accuracy and improvement over time.

This project is an ideal starting point for anyone interested in quantitative trading, financial data analysis, or using machine learning to explore stock market trends.
